# PWA
## TASK-IT!

This application contains the main characteristics that a PWA should have.
In this very basic sample, you will find:
* manifest.json
* Service Worker
* Cache Storage
* Use of localstorage
* Offline-First support
* Mobile-First support

This is a very simple task register application. It integrates JQuery to solve the basic animations of DIVs you can see using it, and also the animations for many other HTML tags. Materialize CSS framework is also integrated, just for solve the UI. Finally, UpUp JS simplifies the Service Worker and the Offline Support.

You can test it in your mobile phone going to the following URL: [My personal website](https://ferpro.online/ejemplos/taskit/). You will see at the bottom of PWA screen the default message: __ADD TO HOME SCREEN__. Tap on that and... Let the magic begin!
After a few seconds, you'll find the PWA icon on the smartphone's __Application Sandbox__. Tap on the icon to start __Task-it! PWA__. If you wanna test its full offline-support, go to the __Airplane mode__ before opening Task-it! PWA.

## MOBILE PLATFORMS
This PWA works fine in most of Web Browsers and also the Operating Systems. I tested it on MacOS, Windows, Android and iPadOS, and in all of them I can use it w/o problem and also install it and run it in Airplane Mode.

A few screenshots of this PWA and how is its behavior according to the type of screen where you are running it.

# PWA
## TASK-IT!

This application contains the main characteristics that a PWA should have. In this very commonly sample, you will find:
* manifest.json
* Service Worker
* Cache Storage
* Use of localstorage
* Offline-First support
* Mobile-First support

This is a very simple task register application. It integrates JQuery to solve the basic animations of <div> and many other HTML tags. Materialize CSS is also integrated, just for solve the UI. Finally, UpUp JS is integrated to simplify the Service Worker and offline support.

You can test it, going from your mobile phone (prefered), to the following URL: [My personal website](https://ferpro.online/ejemplos/taskit/). You will find the PWA and will see on the bottom of screen, the posibility of *ADD TO HOME SCREEN*. Tap on that option and, after a few seconds, you'll find the PWA icon on the Application sandbox of your smartphone. Taping on it the PWA will start and, if you can test it, put your smartphone in Airplane mode previosuly to open the Task-it! PWA.
